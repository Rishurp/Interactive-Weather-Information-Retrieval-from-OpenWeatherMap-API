# Interactive Weather Information Retrieval from OpenWeatherMap API

This Python program interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display hourly weather forecast data for the city of London. The program allows the user to input a date and obtain the temperature, wind speed, and pressure information for that specific date from the API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace the 'API_KEY' variable in the code with your valid API key obtained from the OpenWeatherMap website.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the program using the following command:
   python weather_api.py
5. The program will prompt you to choose an option (1, 2, 3, or 0) and provide the date (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD") when required. Based on your choice, the program will display the weather information accordingly.

## Features

- Fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Interactive command-line interface for user input.
- Provides temperature, wind speed, and pressure for the specified date.
- Modular and well-structured code.

## Note

This code is part of an assignment and follows the specified guidelines not to use any other external APIs, ensuring compliance with the assignment requirements.
